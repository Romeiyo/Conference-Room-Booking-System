# 🏢 Conference Room Booking System

This repository contains a practice project used to demonstrate professional Git, GitHub, and collaboration workflows.

The project simulates a **Conference Room Booking System** that will be expanded over multiple modules to support learning around documentation, APIs, teamwork, and system handover.   
The system will include allowing employees to make and cancel bookings, allowing administrators to resolve conflicting reservations, and rooms can be marked as being under maintenance.
