**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I am always frustrated when I want to book multiple meetings over the span of a week and I have to set up each meeting manually.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I want to be able to click on a checkbox that allows me to make a singular booking that will book the same room with the same details over the multiple days I choose.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
To be able to select all of the days I want to book a meeting for before I input my details, so this removes the need for checkbox that opens a calendar to select the recurring dates after putting in details.

**Additional context**
